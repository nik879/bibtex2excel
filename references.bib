	abstract = {Knowledge production within the field of business research is accelerating at a tremendous speed while at the same time remaining fragmented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.},

The principal question we address is, how effective are the cybersecurity risk management measures of the NIS 2 Directive against cyberattacks on essential and important entities in EU member states? It was observed, through statutory interpretation and cyber kill chain model analysis, that the cybersecurity risk management measures of the NIS 2 Directive may be significantly limited in their effectiveness against cyberattacks on essential and important entities in EU member states. The limited effectiveness is primarily due to the narrow scope of the cybersecurity risk management measures, including the lack of specific measures focused on the reconnaissance phase of a cyberattack.},
